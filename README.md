# Final-Project-AI-Capstone-Project-with-Deep-Learning
I have shared this Gitfront beacause the AI grader has been giving me zeros while saying things are not there that are, and the instructors want a URL but a public URL is not allowed by Coursera. 
The AI grader also has a token error so I cannot submit my Github directly to the AI grader. 
In the discussion form only one person has been able to share Github Url, so i have filed a report under the test itself with the GitHub url in the report. I do not know what else to do.
The Help Center has sent it to the IBM AI Specialist, but has not given me a time frame for this issue being fixed. This issued affects over 50 people. 
Update, projecte was finally submitted through their discussion board. You have to use the post button to for the url and paste in plain text. If that does not work, put your user name, the projects name , the name of the platform your using in a post, or upload screen shots on a post.
