# Final-Project-AI-Capstone-Project-with-Deep-Learning
I have shared this Gitfront beacause the AI grader has been giving me zeros while saying things are not there that are, and the instructors want a URL but a public URL is not allowed by Coursera. 
The AI grader also has a token error so I cannot submit my Github directly to the AI grader.
